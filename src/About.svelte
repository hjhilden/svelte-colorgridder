<div class="intro">This app was created by Jonatan Hildén as part of a Master’s Thesis in Visual Communication Design for Aalto University.

Color schemes can be used with the R package <a href="https://github.com/chris-prener/biscale">biscale</a> or the <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/bivariate-choropleth">Bivariate choropleth example</a> on Observable. 

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
The principle for creating the color palettes builds on the blog post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210424085202/https://www.joshuastevens.net/cartography/make-a-bivariate-choropleth-map/"><i>Bivariate Choropleth Maps: A How-to Guide</i></a> by Joshua Stevens.

Color scale generation is done with <a href="https://gka.github.io/chroma.js/">Chroma.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Myndex/apca-w3">APCA contrast algorithms</a> are used for additional color analysis. <br>

The palette design was inspired by the <a href="https://observablehq.com/@benjaminadk/bivariate-choropleth-color-generator">@benjaminadk/bivariate-choropleth-color-generator</a>.
